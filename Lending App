My first freelance project is a lending application that consists of three main sections:
Dashboard, Loans, and History. The application allows users to add new loans, view
existing loans, and track loan history. It is built with React for the frontend
and Laravel for the backend, utilizing Ant Design for the user interface providing a seamless and efficient user experience.
